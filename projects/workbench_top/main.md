workbench:

* long: 2.2 m
* width: 57 cm
* mental bar suppart top: 4cm
* metal bar's hole under table top(non exist yet): 6mm

## Quick Rule of Thumb: Screw Mounting

**Setup:**
- Metal bar: 4cm thick (screw passes through, doesn't grip)
- Clearance hole: 6mm (screw slides through)
- Screw grips ONLY in timber below
- 6-8 holes per side

**Screw Grip Rule:** Penetrate 6-8x screw diameter into timber

**M4 vs M5:** M5 is stronger (thicker shaft), but M4 grips equally well if drilled deep enough. **M4 safer for 6mm hole** (more clearance).

### Timber Options & Screw Specs:

#### RECOMMENDED: M4 Softwood 4cm thick
- **Screw:** M4 x 65mm wood screw
- **Why M4:** 4mm screw + 6mm hole = 1mm clearance (safe fit)
- **Penetration:** 2.5cm into timber (6x diameter)
- **Pilot hole in timber:** 3mm

#### Option 2: M4 Hardwood 3cm thick
- **Screw:** M4 x 60mm wood screw
- **Penetration:** 2cm into timber (5x diameter - hardwood grips better)
- **Pilot hole in timber:** 3.5mm (hardwood needs wider pilot to prevent splitting)

#### Option 3: M5 Softwood 5cm thick (if hole confirmed 6mm+)
- **Screw:** M5 x 75mm wood screw
- **Why M5:** 5mm screw + 6mm hole = 0.5mm clearance (tight fit, verify hole first!)
- **Penetration:** 3cm into timber (6x diameter)
- **Pilot hole in timber:** 4mm

#### Plywood?
- **NO** - 6-8 screws will strip/delaminate plywood layers

### Shopping List (8 holes per side):

**Best Choice: M4 Softwood 4cm**
- [ ] 8x M4 x 65mm wood screws (countersunk or pan head)
- [ ] 16x M4 flat washers (10mm OD, for top & bottom of metal bar)
- [ ] Softwood: 4cm thick x 57cm x 2.2m
- [ ] 3mm drill bit (pilot holes)
- [ ] 6mm drill bit (if enlarging metal holes)

**Alternative: M4 Hardwood 3cm**
- [ ] 8x M4 x 60mm wood screws
- [ ] 16x M4 flat washers
- [ ] Hardwood: 3cm thick
- [ ] 3.5mm drill bit (pilot holes)

**Pro Tips:**
- M4 safer than M5 for 6mm holes (more tolerance)
- Hardwood needs SAME screw size as softwood (grips better, not worse)
- Washer spreads load, prevents screw head pulling through metal
- Pre-drill timber from bottom up to avoid splitting

## Cost Estimation (Bunnings Australia)
